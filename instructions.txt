Rewards Points System Setup Instructions
=======================================

1. Import the Database
----------------------
* Locate `database/schema.sql` in this project.
* Import it into your MySQL server:
  ```bash
  mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
  ```
* The script will create the `rewards_system` database, tables, sample data, and a default superadmin user.

2. Configure the Application
----------------------------
* Edit `config.php` with your MySQL credentials (`$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, `$dbName`).
* By default the application expects the `rewards_system` database defined in the schema.

3. Default Login
----------------
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123`
* Role: `superadmin`
* Change the default password immediately after your first login via **Profile**.

4. Running the App
------------------
* Place the project in your PHP-capable web server directory (Apache, Nginx, Laragon, XAMPP, etc.).
* Ensure PHP 8.1+ is installed with the mysqli extension enabled.
* Serve the project root (`rewards-app/`).
* Navigate to `/login.php` for the admin portal or `/index.php` for the in-store customer kiosk.

5. Security Recommendations
---------------------------
* Use HTTPS and a strong MySQL password in production.
* Update the default admin credentials.
* Regularly review the **Activity Log** (visible to superadmins) for unusual events.
* Configure proper file permissions so that configuration files are not publicly editable.
* Keep PHP and all dependencies patched.

6. Cron & Maintenance (Optional)
--------------------------------
* Schedule a cron job to archive or prune old activity logs and password reset tokens.
* Back up the database regularly.
* Consider adding rate limiting and CAPTCHA to the login and reset password flows if exposed publicly.

Enjoy the rewards system and customize it as needed for your business.
